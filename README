ConnMan-UI
==========

A full-featured GTK based trayicon UI for ConnMan.

It targets all WM/DM users but Gnome3 ones*. It works on any Linux WM/DM 
which provides a freedesktop compliant system tray. (kde, awesome, ...)

It exposes almost all features provided by ConnMan API (small features are 
missing, see TODO for more information). You can enable/disable a technology 
(wired, wifi, cellular, bt, ...), connect/disconnect a service, configure a 
service (IPv4, IPv6, DNS, Timeservers, etc...), share your current connection 
(tethering) and so on. Everything is accessible through the mouse via the 
trayicon, all with left and right click.


Requirements
------------

- libdbus ( >= 1.4 )
- glib ( >= 2.28 )
- gtk+ ( >=3.0 )


Compilation and installation
----------------------------

./bootstrap && ./configure --prefix=usr && make &&Â sudo make install


Notes
-----

This is an alpha stage software. Though it has proven to be stable, the look and 
feel require still lot of work, thus contributions are welcome!
